# Jumping-Frog-game-using-Turtle
This is my High School Investigatory project for Computer Science.
This project is a simple game created with the help 
of Python Turtle graphics. All the moving objects in the 
game are Turtle objects. Tkinter module is used for 
Graphical User Interface. The game is over when the frog 
gets hit by a car. For each level the player gets 100 points.
